          <h2>Am Not Sure What to Name This</h2>
          Hey, how are you doing. I actually don't even know what am writting on this 
          or even why am writting it. It just feels like the right thing to do.<br>
          
          <br>
          I don't know how you will take this. There is this one issue that has been bugging me since last year. 
          On my side I felt that we were great we were doing great, I enjoyed our conversations every bit of it. 
          I miss that. I miss talking to you with no holds barred. I still enjoy talking to you. You are that single 
          person that I can talk to t anytime time of the day and still be happy to talk to on any topic and not even 
          struggle to think on what to reply. The conversation just flows.

          By the end of August (last year) we would have been marking the third year of our relationship but it did'nt live 
          to see that. you decided to call things of by mid july to be precise ilikua july 15th. You never gave 
          explanation (other than "people change").<br>
          <br>
         
          The thing is I still love you and ild really really like us to rekindle our relationship.<br><br>
          This are different times and am willing to go an extra step to see that what we had does'nt go to waste.
          
          If you are comfortable with bringing us back am down for that. I don't expect things to be exactly the same
          as before. Depends on you though.<br><br>

          It will be foolish to say I did nothing wrong even though I can point out nothing speciffically. Whatever it 
          is that I did or whatever happened am realy sorry that it did happen. Let us work the differences and atleast 
          continue what we started. I love you.<br><br>
